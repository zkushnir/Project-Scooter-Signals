# Project-Scooter-Signals
Personal project to design and prototype a mechatronic turn signal for my scooter

Zachatronic Turn Signal
As a personal project, I challenged myself to design and produce a device that shows drivers in front and behind me that I am turning without having to remove my hand from the handlebar of the scooter for safety. As a result I came up with this design, 3d printed all of the custom parts, programmed a microcontroller, and soldered all of the components together to control this battery operated device.
